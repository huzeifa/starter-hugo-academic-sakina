•Acids are substances turn litmus red and have a pH of less than 7

•Alkalis are substances that turn litmus blue and has a pH more than 7. Alkalis are soluble bases.

•Acids and Bases can cancel each other out to become neutral

•Neutral substances have a pH of 7

•The pH scale measured using Universal Indicator shows the strength of acids and alkalis from 1 to 14.

P﻿ure water is neutral.

T﻿he pH of soil affects flower colour. <!--StartFragment-->

•Hydrangea flowers are blue in acidic soil with a pH of 5.5 or lower. Blooms are pink if soil pH is 7 or higher.

Indicators are substances that change colour in solutions of different acidity and alkalinity.

Examples are:

•natural pH indicators include: Beets: A very basic solution (high pH) will change the color of beets or beet juice from red to purple. Blackberries: Blackberries, black currants, and black raspberries change from red in an acidic environment to blue or violet in a basic environment

•Red cabbage

•Litmus

•Phenolphthalein

•Methyl orange

•Universal indicator

•Litmus, phenolphthalein, methyl orange etc do not show how strong or weak an acid or alkali is, but Universal indicator does.

•Universal indicator is a mixture of indicators that give a range of colours which correspond to the pH of a solution.

•Using a pH meter is a more accurate way of measuring the pH numerically.

•Using pH paper and Univeral Indicator solution shows the colour change and is a simpler way to measure pH.

# N﻿eutralisation

T﻿his is a chemical reaction where an acid and base react together to form a salt and water.

Acid + Base → Salt + Water

Alkalis are bases that are soluble in water.

Acid + Alkali → Salt + Water

Acids and Alkalis cancel each other out (neutralize)

<!--StartFragment-->

Neutralization produces substances called salts.

•Hydrochloric acid produce ‘chloride’ salts

•Sulphuric acid produces ‘sulphate’ Salts

•Nitric acid produces ‘nitrate’ salts

hydrochloric acid + sodium hydroxide → sodium chloride + water

sulphuric acid + lithium hydroxide → lithium sulphate + water

nitric acid  + potassium hydroxide → potassium nitrate + water
