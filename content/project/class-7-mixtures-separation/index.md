Matter mainly exists as a mixture. 

A﻿ mixture is made up of two or more components physically intermixed. 

### T﻿ypes of Mixtures

75% of the Earth is water in which many different substances can dissolve making it become a solution

Water in rivers and streams may also carry solids such as sand, gravel or mud making it a colloid and suspension.

To make water safe for drinking it must be treated in different ways to remove the unwanted substances mixed in it

1. In the first stage of water treatment, waste water (from homes, offices and street drains) passes through a screen, which acts as a sieve to remove large solids such as leaves, rubbish and lumps of human waste, as well as smaller solids.

2: It is then  passed through fine filters and left to stand in large ‘settlement ponds’. This stage removes smaller suspended solids that eventually settle out when the water is still.

3: The water from the settlement ponds is still not clean because very small solids are still dispersed in it. Special substances (coagulants) are added to make these solids clump together. They are then easily separated from the water.

4: Disease-causing microorganisms are too small to be removed by filters or settlement ponds. Drinking water may be treated with chlorine to kill them.
