## <a id="Energyfromfood"></a>Energy from food

Energy is measured in Joules. 
W﻿e get energy from food.
Energy in foods is measured in kiloJoules. It is also measured in kilo Calories. 
1 kCal = 4 kJ
Different people have different energy requirements per day:

# <a id="EnergyTransfers&Stores"></a> Energy Transfers & Stores

Energy can be stored as:

**•Chemical energy** in batteries, food and other fuels like petrol/diesel.

**•Thermal energy** in hot objects

•**Kinetic energy** in all moving objects

**•Elastic potential energy** (strain) in objects which are stretched, twisted, bent or compressed (squashed).

**•Gravitational potential energy** in objects held at high positions.

**•Nuclear** (atomic) energy inside all materials

Energy can be transferred (moved) from a store of energy) by:

**•Forces**

**•Light**

**•Electricity**

**•Sound**

**•Heating**

#### Law of Conservation Of Energy

<!--StartFragment-->

•Since energy is conserved, total energy going into the object equals to the total energy coming out from it.
