•A force is a push or pull on a body.

•Force causes motion: change in speed, direction, shape or size.

•SI Unit of Force: Newton :  N

T﻿ypes of forces:

•Contact Force -  force between objects that are touching each other. e.g friction, upthrust , reaction force

•Non Contact Forces -force between objects that are not touching each other e.g gravitational, magnetic and electrostatic forces

Friction – A force between two objects that are touching. Friction acts to slow objects down. Friction is the force opposing motion. It produces heat.

How is friction reduced?

<!--EndFragment--><!--StartFragment-->

•By lubrication -Using a lubricant – such as oil or grease

•Making the surface smoother

•Streamlined shape to reduce air resistance or water resistance.
