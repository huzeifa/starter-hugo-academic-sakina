A **cell** is the smallest unit of life. 

Cells of the same type make a **tissue**. 

Different tissues make up an **organ**. 

Different organs work together in **organ systems**. 

Many organ systems make up a living thing â€“ an **organism**.

**Life processes**

All organisms carry out the following life processes: 

* Movement - they can move from place to place or move parts of themselves.
* Reproduction - they can make more of themselves.
* Sensitivity - they can sense and respond to stimuli around them.
* Growth - they can increase in size.
* Respiration - they use glucose and oxygen to release energy.
* Excretion - they can produce waste and get rid of it.
* Nutrition - they require food for energy, growth and overall health. 

For anything to be living, it should be able to carry out all the above life processes.
