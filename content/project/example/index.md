A **cell** is the smallest unit of life. 

Cells of the same type make a **tissue**. 

Different tissues make up an **organ**. 

Different organs work together in **organ systems**. 

Many organ systems make up a living thing â€“ an **organism**.

# **Life processes**

All organisms carry out the following life processes: 

* **Movement** - they can move from place to place or move parts of themselves.

  ![](movement.gif "Sunflower plants slowly track the motion of the sun across the sky during the day, and then drift back during the nighttime.")
* **Reproduction** - they can make more of themselves.

![](reproduction.gif "Bacteria are single celled unicellular organisms that reproduce by a process called binary fission.")

* **Sensitivity** - they can sense and respond to changes inside and outside their bodies called stimuli around them.

![](sensitivity.gif "Mimosa pudica is a flowering plant of the pea/legume family. The leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, defending themselves from harm, and re-open a few minutes later.")

* **Growth** - they can increase in size.

![](growth.gif "Seeds germinate using warmth, water and oxygen and the leaves photosynthesize with the help of water and minerals from soil, carbon dioxide and sunlight.")

* **Respiration** - they use glucose and oxygen to release energy.

![](respiration.gif "Energy is released when glucose and oxygen react in our cells to produce carbon dioxide and water.")

* **Excretion** - they can produce waste and get rid of it.

![](excretion.gif "Excretion is the release of waste in the form of urine, sweat and exhalation of carbon dioxide")

* **Nutrition** - they require food for energy, growth and overall health.

For anything to be living, it should be able to carry out all the above life processes.
