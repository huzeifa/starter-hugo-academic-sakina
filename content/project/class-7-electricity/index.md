<!--StartFragment-->

An electric circuit is a path for electric charge (electrons) to flow along.

# S﻿eries and Parallel Circuits

I﻿n a series circuit, all circuit components are connected in one single loop. If one component gets damaged, the entire circuit gets broken.

I﻿n a parallel circuit, there is more than one path around the circuit. There are junctions connecting many branches or loops together in the circuit. If one component in a branch gets damaged, the other branches can still function and the entire circuit does not break.

# Current

Electric current is the rate of flow of charge. It is a measure of how many electrons flow every second at a point in the circuit.  \
An ammeter measures current in a circuit. The ammeter is connected in series in the circuit. 

T﻿he units of current are Amperes or Amps

Current is the same everywhere in a series circuit.

C﻿urrent is shared across branches in a parallel circuit. The current entering the circuit is split across the branches and then is added up again so that current leaving the circuit is the same as current entering it.

# V﻿oltage

Voltage is the push given to electrons by a power source such as a cell or battery. Voltage is a measure of the energy transferred across each component in the circuit. 

V﻿oltage is measured using a voltmeter. The units for voltage are the Volts.

I﻿n a series circuit voltage from the power source is shared by the components in the series circuit.

I﻿n a parallel circuit voltage is the same across each branch of the parallel circuit.
