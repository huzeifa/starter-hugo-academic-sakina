<!--StartFragment-->

An electric circuit is a path for electric charge (electrons) to flow along.

# S﻿eries and Parallel Circuits

I﻿n a series circuit, all circuit components are connected in one single loop. If one component gets damaged, the entire circuit gets broken.

I﻿n a parallel circuit, there is more than one path around the circuit. There are junctions connecting many branches or loops together in the circuit. If one component in a branch gets damaged, the other branches can still function and the entire circuit does not break.

# Current

Electric current is the rate of flow of charge. It is a measure of how many electrons flow every second at a point in the circuit.  \
An ammeter measures current in a circuit. The ammeter is connected in series in the circuit. 

T﻿he units of current are Amperes or Amps

Current is the same everywhere in a series circuit.

C﻿urrent is shared accross branches in a parallel circuit. The current entering the circuit is split across the branches and then is added up again so that current leaving the circuit is the same as current entering it.
