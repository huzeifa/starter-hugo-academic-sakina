Food contains nutrients needed for energy, growth and repair, and for health.

Nutrition information labels can tell us how much of each nutrient can be eaten in a day (reference intake) and how much of that nutrient is in the particular food. This helps you know how much of the food you need to eat.

Nutrition labels give you the amount of energy in food (in kilo Joules and kilo Calories). 1 kilocalorie = 4 kiloJoules. Energy requirements change with age, type of activity and gender.

## Uses of Nutrients

* Water – transports the nutrients in the body, acts as a lubricant, fills up cells so that they hold their shape and cools us down when we sweat.
* Protein– help in making new cells for growth and repair. Found in meat, fish eggs, cheese, beans and milk.

* Carbohydrates– for energy. Found in starchy foods like bread and potatoes and sugary foods containing glucose.

* Lipids (fats and oils)– are a source of energy and provide insulation. Found in dairy products and oily foods. 

* Vitamins and minerals– for overall body health and protection from disease. 
* Fibre - is not a nutrient but needed as roughage – Fibre contains plant cell walls which cannot be digested but helps food move through the intestine to prevent constipation.



## Food Tests

* To test for the presence of **water** in a particular food, blue cobalt chloride paper is used. It turns pink, in the presence of water.

* T﻿o test for the presence of the carbohydrate **starch** in a particular food, iodine is used. Brown iodine turns blue-black in the presence of starch.

* T﻿o test for the presence of **fats** in a particular food, add ethanol and then the same amount of water. A white emulsion will be formed if fats are present.

* T﻿o test for the presence of **protein** in a particular food, blue Biuret solution turns purple in the presence of protein.

#### Balanced Diet 

A balanced diet contains the right amount of a wide variety of foods that can provide all nutrients + fibre for growth and repair, health and energy.

#### Malnutrition

Too much or too little of a nutrient in your diet can make you malnourished.
Too much of carbohydrates and fats can cause obesity which leads to heart disease. The extra fat can clog arteries and cause heart attack. Higher pressure on artery walls results in high blood pressure which further damages the heart and bursts blood vessels and damages kidneys.

**Deficiency diseases** are caused by too little of a certain nutrient. The tables below show the vitamin and mineral deficiency diseases.
