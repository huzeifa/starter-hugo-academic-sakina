* **Movement** - they can move from place to place or move parts of themselves.

  ![Sunflower plants slowly track the motion of the sun across the sky during the day, and then drift back during the nighttime.](https://www.thescienceteacher.co.ke/project/example/movement.gif "* Sunflower plants slowly track the motion of the sun across the sky during the day, and then drift back during the nighttime.")
* **Reproduction** - they can make more of themselves.

![Bacteria are single celled unicellular organisms that reproduce by a process called binary fission.](https://www.thescienceteacher.co.ke/project/example/reproduction.gif "Bacteria are single celled unicellular organisms that reproduce by a process called binary fission.")

* **Sensitivity** - they can sense and respond to changes inside and outside their bodies called stimuli around them.

![Mimosa pudica is a flowering plant of the pea/legume family. The leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, defending themselves from harm, and re-open a few minutes later.](https://www.thescienceteacher.co.ke/project/example/sensitivity.gif "Mimosa pudica is a flowering plant of the pea/legume family. The leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, defending themselves from harm, and re-open a few minutes later.")

* **Growth** - they can increase in size.

![Seeds germinate using warmth, water and oxygen and the leaves photosynthesize with the help of water and minerals from soil, carbon dioxide and sunlight.](https://www.thescienceteacher.co.ke/project/example/growth.gif "Seeds germinate using warmth, water and oxygen and the leaves photosynthesize with the help of water and minerals from soil, carbon dioxide and sunlight.")

* **Respiration** - they use glucose and oxygen to release energy.

![Energy is released when glucose and oxygen react in our cells to produce carbon dioxide and water.](https://www.thescienceteacher.co.ke/project/example/respiration.gif "Energy is released when glucose and oxygen react in our cells to produce carbon dioxide and water.")

* **Excretion** - they can produce waste and get rid of it.

![Excretion is the release of waste in the form of urine, sweat and exhalation of carbon dioxide](https://www.thescienceteacher.co.ke/project/example/excretion.gif "Excretion is the release of waste in the form of urine, sweat and exhalation of carbon dioxide")

* **Nutrition** - they require food for energy, growth and overall health.

For anything to be living, it should be able to carry out all the above life processes.
