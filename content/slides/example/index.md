## WHAT MAKES SOMETHING LIVING?

{{% fragment %}}

In order for something to be considered living, it should carry out all the 7 life processes: movement, reproduction, sensitivity, growth, respiration, excretion and nutrition

## WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CELLS, TISSUES AND ORGANS?

{{% fragment %}}

O﻿rgans are made up of different tissues working together. Tissues are made up of cells of the same type to carry out a function. Cells are the smallest unit of life that carry out all seven life processes.

## NAME A PLANT ORGAN SYSTEM AND STATE ITS FUNCTION.

{{% fragment %}}

The water transport system in plants takes water from the ground up to the leaves. 

T﻿he root system anchors the plant and absorbs water and minerals which get carried to the shoot system.

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE HEART?

{{% fragment %}}

H﻿eart - pumps blood through the blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions.

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE LUNGS?

{{% fragment %}}

L﻿ungs - provide oxygen from inhaled air to the bloodstream and remove carbon dioxide from the blood.

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE LIVER?

{{% fragment %}}

L﻿iver - helps break down fats by producing bile, produces urea, detoxifies blood and maintains a proper level of glucose in the blood. 

 {{% /fragment %}}

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE STOMACH?

{{% fragment %}}

S﻿tomach - digestion of food through production of gastric juices (including hydrochloric acid) which break down, mix and churn the food into a thin liquid.

 {{% /fragment %}}

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE SMALL AND LARGE INTESTINES?

{{% fragment %}}

I﻿ntestines - the small intestine absorbs most ingested food in the blood. The large intestine is responsible for absorption of water and excretion of solid waste material.

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE KIDNEYS?

{{% fragment %}}

K﻿idneys - maintain the body’s chemical balance by excreting waste products and excess fluid in the form of urine.

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE BLADDER?

{{% fragment %}}

Bladder- stretches to store urine and contracts to release urine.

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF PLANT ROOTS?

{{% fragment %}}

R﻿oots - anchor the plant to the ground and absorb water and minerals from the ground.

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE STEM OF A PLANT?

{{% fragment %}}

S﻿tem- holds the plant upright and transports water and nutrients from roots to the leaves.

 {{% /fragment %}}

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF LEAVES?

{{% fragment %}}

L﻿eaves - trap sunlight to make food for the plant by the process of photosynthesis.

## WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF PLANT BULBS, TUBERS & STORAGE ROOTS?

{{% fragment %}}

P﻿lant storage organs e.g. bulbs, storage roots and tubers - store food and water for the plant to use when needed.

## DESCRIBE THREE TYPES OF MUSCLE TISSUE

{{% fragment %}}

1. Cardiac muscle tissue - found in the heart

2﻿. Smooth muscle tissue - found in walls of internal organs.

3﻿. Skeletal muscle tissue - attached to bones

## W﻿HAT IS THE PURPOSE OF FAT TISSUE?

{{% fragment %}}

The layer of fat tissue under the skin insulates the body to keep it warm. Pads of fat act as shock absorbers and support and cushion vital organs. The stored fat also provide energy when required.

## HOW ARE RED BLOOD CELLS ADAPTED FOR THEIR FUNCTION?

{{% fragment %}}

* They have a biconcave shape which provides a large surface area for oxygen to pass into them.
* They contain hemoglobin which joins with oxygen.
* They have no nucleus so there is maximum space for oxygen to be carried
