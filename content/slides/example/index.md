H﻿eart - pumps blood through the blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions.

L﻿ungs - provide oxygen from inhaled air to the bloodstream and remove carbon dioxide from the blood.

L﻿iver - helps break down fats, produce urea, detoxify blood and maintain a proper level of glucose in the blood. 

S﻿tomach - digestion of food through production of gastric juices (including hydrochloric acid) which break down, mix and churn the food into a thin liquid.

I﻿ntestines - the small intestine absorbs most ingested food in the blood. The large intestine is responsible for absorption of water and excretion of solid waste material.

K﻿idneys - maintain the body’s chemical balance by excreting waste products and excess fluid in the form of urine.
