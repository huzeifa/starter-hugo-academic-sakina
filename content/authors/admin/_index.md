I have 5 years of experience in teaching Grade 7, 8 and 9 students biology, chemistry and physics.  I give importance to planning well for my lessons and conducting them using a variety of teaching methods and resources. I aim to make my students understand the subject content so that they can be able to apply it to real life.
