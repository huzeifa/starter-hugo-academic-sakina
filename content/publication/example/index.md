abstract: "Curiosity is a means for students to fill in gaps in their knowledge.
  If their curiosity gets satisfied they are able to comfortably further their
  education. If not, the gaps remain unfilled and the students are left with a
  shallow knowledge base. They resort to cramming notes and information given by
  their teachers which they don’t truly understand and which is later ignored
  and forgotten. The continuous assessment test scores of 65 undergraduate
  students from the Catholic University of Eastern Africa’s Faculty of Education
  were analyzed in accordance with the student’s level of curiosity. A trend
  showing that a student’s level of curiosity affects his/her retention of
  subject matter with regard to their test scores was observed. The students
  were questioned on what affects their level of curiosity in their respective
  subjects and factors such as quality of their lecturer’s delivery of the
  subject content, level of understanding what the lecturer’s teach and the
  amount of theory, influenced their curiosity in their subjects.  The lecturers
  teaching the students were interviewed on how to increase their students’
  level of curiosity and they suggested on interactive learning, using audio and
  visual aids, use of technology and integration of various teaching methods.
  These research findings call for a change in education systems whereby
  educators encourage and trigger the curiosity of their students in their
  classes, in order to smoothen their students’ transition from the known to the
  unknown. "
